As a result, basic stack operations were used in this problem. The input file serves as the postfix operation,
through which we must perform basic arithmetic operations to obtain stack.top() as the final operation. When 
any arithmetic operation falls on the side of the stack, two operators are carried away further along with the
operation and previous numerals are popped out by replacing with desired operated value, 
and the process is repeated until we get the desired single output.
